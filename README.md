# Design Thinking 
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Design Thinking is the process of creating solutions to solve problems.  It can help to improve the products by asking users for feedback after using the product.
The design thinking process has five phases that are Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test. We submitted our prototype and report on 30th November 2023. We did our design thinking presentation on 20 December 2023. We present our slides for around 10 minutes and we have a Q and A session for around 5 minutes.</p>

<h2>Questions asked during Q and A session: </h2>
<p>1. How do student bounties app enhance social between students and seniors?</p>
<p>Answer: Solubillion is mainly focused on academic purpose. However, there is an optional rewards function in the Solubillion app, so students can give optional rewards to seniors and enhance social between seniors and students.</p>
<p>2. How to ensure privacy in the student bounties app?</p>
<p>Answer: In solubillion, when you signed up as a user for the app, you are required to fill in your details for example your matric number and also set a strong password. With a strong password, other users cannot get in your account easily. Besides, we can track the user if they did any suspicious action in the app by using the details they have provided when they are signing up as a user. </p>
<p>3. How do you generate an income for the app maintainance?</p>
<p>Answer: We mostly generate our income through ads. </p>

<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>After doing design thinking, I learned how to communicate with our teammates to get great ideas to build apps. I also learned how to build an app prototype using proto.io software witht the help of my teammates. The improvement that I want to make in the future is I want to build a better prototype, this is the first time I build an app protoype, the prototype is not perfect yet, I would like to make a nicer prototype in the future. In my opinion, I am very greateful to have my teammates for this design thinking project, teamwork is very important, I would not be able to finish this project without my teammates' help.</p>
