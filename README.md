<h2>Questions asked during Q and A session</h2>
<p>1. How do student bounties app enhance social between students and seniors?</p>
<p>Answer: Solubillion is mainly focused on academic purpose. However, there is an optional rewards function in the Solubillion app, so students can give optional rewards to seniors and enhance social between seniors and students.</p>
<p>2. How to ensure privacy in the student bounties app?</p>
<p>Answer: In solubillion, when you signed up as a user for the app, you are required to fill in your details for example your matric number and also set a strong password. With a strong password, other users cannot get in your account easily. Besides, we can track the user if they did any suspicious action in the app by using the details they have provided when they are signing up as a user. </p>
<p>3. How do you generate an income for the app maintainance?</p>
<p>Answer: We mostly generate our income through ads. </p>
