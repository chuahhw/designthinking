Empathize
We conducted a survey to UTM students about the challenges they faced while answering hard questions in assignments. We conducted the survey using Google form and sent it to the student MPP telegram group chat. Besides that, we were able to have some phone interviews with a first-year student who is studying electronics engineering at the University of Technology Malaysia. Through the interviews, we get to know that the problems faced by students in answering assignments.
