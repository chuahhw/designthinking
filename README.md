Design Thinking Report
<p>
	<b> 1. Introduction</b>
	<p>
		Design Thinking is the process of creating solutions to solve problems. Every field can use Design Thinking to solve the problems faced in daily life. It 		can help to improve the products by asking users for feedback after using the product. The design thinking process has five phases that are Empathize, 			Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test.

	<b>2. Detail Step and descriptions and evidence for each phase</b>
	<p>We found that UTM students are having issues with answering tough questions in assignments. We decided to solve the problem through a design thinking process.</p>

	<b>Empathize</b>
	<p>
		We conducted a survey to UTM students about the challenges they faced while answering hard questions in assignments. We conducted the survey using Google 		form and sent it to the student MPP telegram group chat. Besides that, we were able to have some phone interviews with a first-year student who is studying 		electronics engineering at the University of Technology Malaysia. Through the interviews, we get to know that the problems faced by students in answering 		assignments.

	<p><b>Define</b></p>
	<p>
		We identify the problems that are encountered by the students of UTM when answering tough questions in assignments. The junior studentâ€™s inability to access 		senior students to seek help and reluctance to bother lecturers results in uncertainty when answering tough questions. Besides, students also lack of a
 		platform to ask challenging questions.

	<p>(The problems)</p>
 </p>
 <p>
	 <p><b>Ideate</b></p>
	<p>Our group members started to brainstorm ideas. After a many conversations and refining ideas that were thrown around between each other, we have decided on a 	conclusion: develop an app named Solubillion where UTM students can post questions they struggle with. This app also allows seniors to provide solutions and 		explanations for those questions. After the questions have been answered, juniors can use the reward options in the app as a "thank you" gift for seniors. </p>

 </p>
 <p>
	 <p><b>Prototype</b></p>
	<p></p>After that, we created a prototype. In our prototype, students can post questions and answer the questions of others as well. Monetary rewards for more complicated questions are also available. The prototype includes a page to sign in and out, with data saved for future reference, a home page for quick access and regularly used functions, a "My Posts" section to check up on previous posts and to see if anyone has answered your questions and section dedicated to other questions posted by students that are referred as "bounties". Students can navigate these "bounties" and click to show a more detailed context of the question. Prototype is created using software proto.io.</p>
